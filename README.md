# CMPSC-221
## Object Oriented Programming with Web-Based Applications
This respository contains my work from Cmpsc 221 at Penn State. The class was taught by Professor Richard Martin in the Fall of 2020. The class covered advanced object-oriented principles and their application to web-based, net-centric computing.
